		    	<h1>QB</h1>

		    	<p><strong>A joint collaboration between:</strong> Aleksandra Jankowska, Andy Sun, Alyssa Joines & Lillian Crandall.</p>
		    	
		    	<p id="intro">Imagine a monolithic, modernist 1-ton black cube towering over rushing commuters. Next to it, a tiny makeshift, 20 pound cube, chatting with people as they walked by. Responding to initial prompts such as <span>“Hey,”</span> and <span>“Can you hear me,”</span> people would respond with <span>“How’s the rent in there?”</span> or with just a simple <span>"Hello."</span> Accessible and approachable, the chatty box disrupted the monotony and habits of standard commuters and created a playful creatique of monolithic institutions.</p>

			    <p>The initial phase was taken up by <span>extensive research into the space.</span> It was vital to understand the space as a <span>commute route, who travels through it, at what times, for what purpose etc.</span> The first iteration of the installation is made with <span>low fidelity materials,</span> using a simple, cardboard box on a wooden dowel. The audio device implemented within was a JBL 2.0 speaker connected to a phone using Bluetooth.</p>

				<p>Due to <span>weather and strong winds,</span> there was a fast realization that the base of the QB needed to be weighted down more, as well as be wider. <span>The audio was also an issue,</span> as it was hard to hear due to the wind and outside noise. The cardboard cube served its function as a prototype, <span>providing vital knowledge</span> for the second iteration.</p>

			    <p>Throughout the process of rebuilding the QB, <span>new materials were used.</span> Wood for the outline of the structure and the base, and muslin to cover the faces. The idea behind it was to make the installation <span>more aesthetic, as well as add rigidity,</span> so that the QB could be spun and interacted with more. The base was also wider and heavier in order to <span>prevent the wind from bashing it too much.</span></p>

				<p>The <span>wind was even stronger</span> on the weekend the installation was deployed. It was <span>impossible</span> to maintain the installation, therefore it was <span>moved to the next day.</span> Conditions were much more favorable and the QB was <span>interacted with and received favorable reactions</span> from both children and kids.</p>

				<p id = "concluding">All in all, the QB was meant to garner a response of <span>positivity and humor.</span> While not being the rigid, loud structure hoped for, it was a comedical satire, seeing the monolith towering over its little minature.</p>
